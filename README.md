# Welcome to the Hackathon!

This is your own repository that contains the React.js frontend as well as both backend stubs, one based on LangChain and the other one implementing OpenAI Functions without other libraries.

To start, choose your backend-stub and read through the instructions in the README.md in the corresponding directory... there is not really more information here... just looked a little bit sad without any readme file, so there you go ;)
