# Hackathon v2 Frontend: React.js

This is the React.js Frontend for the `hackathon-v2-backend-...` projects. It serves as a simple chatbot-interface with a single conversation.

## Start the Project

To start the project, you first have to install Node and npm by downloading it from the [official website](https://nodejs.org/en/download/prebuilt-installer). After npm is available on your system, install die required libraries by running

```bash
npm install
```

That creates the `node_modules` directory in your project workspace.

After successfully installing the dependencies, run

```bash
npm start
```

to start the application. A browser window will spin up showing the chat interface that you can use, to interact with the backend.

```text
NOTE: Prompting fails, if you did not start the backend yet!
```
